<h1>The Effects of Electronic Books Designed for Children in Education </h1>

        <h4> ABSTRACT </h4>
        <div class="container">
            <p class="electronic"><b><i>Electronic books are quickly becoming more prominent in the field of education because of their
                advantages over traditional printed textbooks. As more electronic textbooks are being produced and
                utilized in classrooms, we must investigate just how useful and effective they are in teaching young
                children the important skills they need for higher learning. This paper reviews some of the current
                views on the topic for teaching and learning and discusses how electronic books can be integrated into
                the classroom learning environment. Research has shown that when used as a teaching supplement,
                electronic books have a positive impact on learning. They can be valuable in helping children with their
                early literacy development, reading comprehension, and language development.</p> <br>

        <h3> I. Introduction </h3>
        <p> <br>Electronic 
            books (or e-books) can be defined
            as any group of text in a digital format that
            is to be read and displayed on a computer
            screen. They can be accessed in a myriad of
            different ways including through the internet, on a
            CD-ROM or by many of the portable e-book
            readers available on the market. Many types of
            content are also available for free download or
            purchase including popular fiction, non-fiction, as
            well as educational titles (Maynard, 2005, p. 103).
            This emerging technology has opened the
            possibility for a large range of new learning
            experiences for students because of its advantages
            over traditional printed textbooks. Electronic
            books often contain rich multimedia features that
            cannot be found in textbooks. These frequently
            include recordings of the text read-aloud, lively
            animations, music, video and various sound
            effects. Young children are found to especially
            respond well to these enhanced features (Korat,
            2008, p.111). Many companies are now producing
            more electronic textbooks for use in classrooms as
            researchers believe that they can prove to be
            excellent supplementary material for teachers, as
            well as being quite effective in early literacy
            development, reading comprehension and language 
            development for young children (De
            Jong, 2004; Grant, 2004; Grimshaw, 2007;
            Higgins, 1999; Korat, 2008; Lewin, 2000;
            Maynard, 2005). This paper highlights the
            successes of children’s interactions with electronic
            books in their learning environments. </p> <br>

          <h3>Studies on Children’s Interactions with E-books:</h3> 
          <p><br>Grimshaw (2007) believes that rich multimedia
            features such as audio narration, sound effects and
            animations embedded into electronic books can
            very much help children improve their reading
            comprehension skills. The reasoning is that these
            features support the text, help the child "decode"
            new words and children actually improve on their
            understanding of the text (p.584). If a book has
            audio narration and also highlights the text as it
            goes along, the child is able to follow along much
            easier. Sound and 3-D animation in the electronic
            text can help illustrate meaning to young children
            and can provide better examples in comparison to
            a traditional 2-dimensional book. Voice narration
            also aids children in pronunciation of particular
            words and helps with understanding of syntax.
            Children also respond well to these features
            because if they need help defining or pronouncing
            the words, they can instantly access help for themselves within the electronic book. There is the
            added advantage of a degree of privacy as many
            children are shy and reluctant to ask a teacher for
            help in a classroom setting. Some children are
            impatient, choosing to ignore the fact that they do
            not understand the text, and will just keep on
            reading anyway (p.585). When children are
            motivated to read and to do so without fear of
            failure, they also tend to excel in reading at or
            above their grade level (p.586). Electronic texts
            can provide this kind of support to them because it
            actively engages their minds.
         </p> <br> 
        <p> Many researchers acknowledge the
            difficulty in measuring comprehension of text
            (Grimshaw, 2007; Grant, 2004; Higgins, 1999). It
            can be very complicated simply because of many
            of the other complex variables involved, one of
            which is memory. Children can often forget parts
            of the narrative when a person asks them to re-tell
            the story or answer questions based on their
            reading of a text for purposes of testing. Just
            because they may forget some of the events of the
            reading, it does not necessarily mean they failed to
            grasp the concepts of the story. Grimshaw’s 2007
            study on children’s reading and comprehension
            skills based on print versus electronic text attempts
            to resolve this issue by allowing children to have
            access to the text as they are being tested. They
            also challenge the children in their study to make
            inferences to test their deeper understanding of the
            story. They did not want to have the children
            simply practice information retrieval (p. 586).
            They tested children under several different
            conditions including having them read the
            electronic text of the storybook with and without
            narration, animations and sound effects. Although
            the results showed that children took longer
            reading from a computer screen when compared to
            a printed book, the children who read from the
            book took longer to answer the comprehension
            test. The children who had been placed in the test
            group that had access to a CD-ROM version of the
            story with narration turned on generally did the
            best on the comprehension test. However, no other
            significant results could be seen amongst the other
            groups. Some useful and pertinent observations from the test included that the children made very
            good use of the electronic dictionary that was
            easily accessible within the CD-ROM version of
            the text (p. 595). This far exceeded any use that
            came from the paper version of the dictionary.
            Children also generally like following the text of a
            traditional printed book with their finger. They
            were unable to do so with the electronic text that
            was displayed to them on the computer, and this
            must have factored into the slower reading time as
            well (p. 596). Additional students also mentioned
            that narration in the electronic version helped them
            when they did not know the pronunciations of
            certain words (p. 597).</p> <br> 
       <p>  Maynard (2005) also conducted a study
            comparing how much children learn from
            electronic text in comparison to printed text. This
            test differentiates itself from other tests in the fact
            that children were tested both on an individual
            basis as well as learning in groups. Half the
            children used a printed book to answer questions
            and the other half used an electronic CD-ROM,
            which was filled with animations, sound effects,
            music and video. The results showed that those
            who used the electronic textbook did better on the
            comprehension tests than those who used the
            printed textbook even though they did take longer
            to find the relevant answers to the questions they
            were asked. The researcher observed that the
            children who were working with the CD-ROM
            version of the text seemed to be more productive
            and were quieter using the text in groups. They all
            took turns rotating around the computer to ensure
            everyone had a turn accessing the text. It was a
            very different scenario compared to the students
            using the printed textbook. These children seemed
            bored and uninterested easily. The researcher did
            concede that there might have just been a “novelty
            effect” (p. 110) with the students using the CD-
            ROM version of the textbook. Another point to
            note is that the children who were using the CD-
            ROM version had to ask several times for help
            including questions on how to navigate back to the
            different sections that they needed as there are no
            simple search ability. The children using the
            textbook needed no help using it, as children are generally familiar and competent in learning to use
            the contents and index pages of a book. This is a
            clear advantage that this medium has over
            electronic text (p. 111).</p> <br>
            <p>De Jong’s study on children’s
                understanding of stories presented to them
                electronically posits that additional features such
                as sound effects and animations actually can
                interfere with children’s comprehension of the text
                (2004, p. 381). She believes that they can easily
                get distracted and miss important plot elements.</p><br>

            <p> 
                Although animations and such found in electronic
                books are without a doubt, appealing and
                attractive to children, De Jong says children
                understand the story more when an adult reads the
                text to them in a story time setting (p. 381). She
                completed a study in 2004 examining whether or
                not there are differences in comprehension with
                children listening to a narration of a story from an
                electronic text and children having the same text
                read to them by an adult. The researcher asked the
                children to re-tell the story that they had just heard
                (whether it was electronically, or through an adult)
                to them orally again and their results were coded.
                Her belief is that electronic books can certainly
                supplement children’s education, but is still no
                true replacement for an adult reading them a
                storybook. words after they had worked through the
                electronic book (p. 121). The best results came
                from the group who worked with the electronic
                book in the “read story with dictionary” mode, as
                they were able to have instant access to the
                definitions of words that were unfamiliar to them. </p> <br>
            <p> Higgins (1999) conducted a study to find
                out if vocabulary-building activities are effective
                when paired with animation in electronic books. In
                the control group, the children listened as the
                computer read a page of a poem to them, and then
                they watched animated definitions of specific new
                words on-screen. The researcher asked if that
                helped them understand the meaning the word. If
                they said “no”, they were permitted to access the
                animation again. In the experimental group, a
                researcher was able to speak and interact with the
                children if they viewed the animation and they still
                did not understand the meaning of the world. They
                could give a definition and also provide the
                children with a synonym (p. 427). Several days
                later, the children that participated in the study
                were tested to see if they could define certain
                words that were in the previous readings. The
                results of this study indicated that the children
                who had adult help and other instructional
                activities performed better on the test. This shows
                that vocabulary-building activities can be
                supplemented with the aid of electronic books to
                produce the best results. </p> <br>
                <p> Electronic books have also proven to be
                    able to help children with brain developmental
                    disabilities such as autism. One study learned that
                    comprehension and reading skills of autistic
                    children increased when they began to learn with
                    computers and electronic books. Their electronic
                    program consisted of flashcards with words on
                    them, letter identification and short reading
                    passages. The children showed improvement in
                    their development of vocabulary (Grant, 2004, p.
                    305). Children with other physical and learning
                    disabilities can also benefit from using electronic
                    books in the classroom. Their ability to translate
                    text-to-speech gives young readers confidence and
                    greatly boosts their self-esteem and projected self-worth (Rhodes, 2008, p. 256). Lewin (2000) also
                    conducted a study where 16 children aged 5-6
                    years old used talking electronic book software
                    daily for a month. It was found that they were
                    useful in supplementing lessons in the classroom
                    and that the children improved in their cognitive
                    skills.</p> <br> 
                <p> Hill (1996) says electronic books are more
                    appealing to children then traditional printed
                    books. They bring the story to life to children in a
                    rather lively way. It presents to them a brand new
                    perspective and makes learning a magical
                    experience. We should not worry about whether or
                    not they will replace books and think of them
                    more as another engaging way for children to
                    learn. They can just insert the CD-ROM into their
                    own computer and learn independently through
                    these images and words. Their learning is not so
                    limited anymore and their imaginations are free to
                    roam.</p> <br> 

                    <h3> Conclusion: </h3>
                    <p> <br> The topic of electronic texts and their advantages
                        in education is a rich and fertile ground for further
                        study and analysis. The multitude of attitudes and
                        viewpoints presented here is just a starting point.
                        Although many researchers agree that children's
                        enjoyment of electronic books might just be the
                        novelty factor, there are also documented cases
                        where electronic books can support literacy and
                        further language development. The added
                        functionality and interactivity available in
                        electronic textbooks can greatly benefit children.
                        Most children are already exposed to computers
                        and technology in our evolving fast-paced world,
                        and they generally enjoy interacting with
                        electronic books very much. They show more co-
                        operation with their peers and retain more
                        information after using an electronic book.
                        Electronic textbooks can have the ability to
                        support learning and comprehension levels seem
                        to increase when children use them in classrooms.
                        Teachers and other educators should look at
                        perhaps implementing electronic texts in their
                        teaching methods in the near future if they have
                        not done so already.</p> <br>
