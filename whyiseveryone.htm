        that everybody is picking on you?<br>
    </p><br>
  
    <p><b>Boys Will Be Boys A Story</b> Whack! You feel a sharp pain in your back. You spin
        around in anger to see the boy who threw the ball and hit you.<br>
        "Hey, you, Jack! I'll get you for that!" you yell at him,
        clenching your fists as you walk in his direction. Your palms
        sweat and your eyes harden as you approach this smaller and
        younger boy. "I could put your lights out for hitting me!" you
        say to him as you grab his shirt.        
    </p><br>
     
    <p> "I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hit you. It was an accident,"
        the smaller boy says fearfully. He is so afraid of you, his body
        is shaking. You feel a surge of power from his fear. You know
        you are in control.
        
    </p><br>
    
    <p>Other kids on the playground gather about you as you
        continue to harass this younger boy.
        "Oh, sure. It was no mistake, punk. You're asking for a
        bruising!"
    </p><br>


    <p>You feel the eyes of your classmates on you. You feel that
        they admire your strength, and fear it at the same time. Most
        of the kids keep away from you. The few buddies you have
        hang out with you because they also think bullying other kids
        is having a good time.        
    </p><br>

    <p> "Stop that, this minute!" you hear Mrs. Potter, the
        playground supervisor, command from across the yard. She is
        coming toward you at full steam, her finger wagging "Bad boy!"
        and her tone threatening the vice principal's office again.        
    </p><br>

    <p> What a dope she is," you think to yourself. "She can't
        scare me. All the vice principal can do is send me home. Then
        what? No one's there and they don't care anyhow."
        "Let go of Mark right now, or I'll send you to Mr. Nathan.
        
    </p><br>

    <p> You are a bully. Don't you think that you can get away with
        this behavior. I won't tolerate it. Why can't you be good, like
        Mark? He wouldn't start a fight; he has fine manners. You're
        a troublemaker, and you always will be as far as I'm
        concerned," she lectures.
        Mrs. Potter puts her hand on your arm and you push it off.
        You let go of Mark to face Mrs. Potter. "You're not one of my
        parents. You can't tell me what to do," you yell back at her
        defiantly, your hands on your hips, your feet apart.
        "Come with me. We are going to the vice principal's office
        right now," she insists.
        </p><br>


    <p>"No way. I'm out of here!" You run across the yard and to
        the field beyond the school, yelling names back at the
        playground supervisor and the group of kids that are standing
        around. "Jerks, punks! I'll get you yet! All of you! You wait
        and see!"        
    </p><br>

    <p> After school you meet your two buddies, Mac and Tom. You
        hang out behind the stores downtown in the empty lot where
        you throw rocks at bottles and smoke cigarettes that you stole
        from your parents.
    </p><br>

    <p> It's getting dark and your buddies and you start to go
        home. As you arrive at your house, your mother pulls up in her
        new, expensive foreign car. Your dad is still at work, as usual.
        Both of them work six days a week, usually into the late
        evening hours. Walking into the house, you see your big sister
        crashed out on the sofa, eating pizza and watching TY.
        "Hey, weirdo. -How goes it?" she sneers. "Failing all your
        subjects as usual?" You don't respond. "Got into a fight today,
        I heard."        
    </p><br>

    <p> "Aw shut up," you snap back at her, heading into the
        kitchen to see what you can find to eat.
        ''You're going to end up a bum or a convict, if you don't
        watch out, you know," your sister yells with a mouth full of
        doughy pizza. ''You're just too dumb to learn. You're going to
        flunk everything if you don't straighten out, ya' hear me?"
        You get some leftover pizza, a coke and some chocolate
        doughnuts and go into the living room to watch TV. Your
        mother has gone into her office upstairs to make some phone
        calls.        
    </p><br>

    <p>"Change the channel," you command your bigger sister
        with a look of anger. "I want to watch 'Rambo IV' and it's on
        now."        
    </p><br>

    <p>"You always watch that macho junk," your sister says, not
        looking at you, and not changing the channel. ''You should
        watch something more intelligent instead of all that warstuff.
        It'll pollute your brain." She looks at you. "Maybe it's too late.
        Your brain has turned to mush already. Why can't you be more
        like Jason? He gets good grades and everyone likes him. He's
        a better brother than you," she says, smugly. "Did you hear
        he's getting a football scholarship to State?"
        
    </p><br>


    <p>"Jason's a fake. He wants to be just like Dad, a big
        success. But he's just a phony. You think I'm a bully? So is he.
        But he's sly like a fox. He sweet-talks all his teachers. They'd
        do anything for him. He's just like the rest of those phony
        jocks he hangs out with. They're all alike. They play the same
        game, and I'm not talking about football. They get into college
        and get all the big-time lawyer, banker, stock market jobs.
        They're all phonies. But try to get in their way and they'll
        knock you over. Rambo's nothing but mush compared to those guys. Talk about aggressive! But everyone loves them
        for it, because they're playing the success game."        
    </p><br>


    <p> (Secretly, you are jealous of your brother, because your
        Mom and Dad always seem to favor him. When you and Jason
        were younger, he used to beat you up a lot. He really hurt you.
        When you told Mom and Dad, Jason would lie and say that you
        started it. You always got the blame and Jason usually got off
        with a slight reprimand. "Boys will be boys," your father used
        to say, patting Jason on the back while giving you a
        disapproving look. The memory fuels your anger and you're
        boiling inside.)        
    </p><br>

    <p>"Change the channel before I give you one," you threaten
        your sister. She knows you mean business.
        "I might as well. You probably can't understand this
        program anyhow. Your level of mentality is just above a cave
        man's. You can't even talk intelligently. No wonder you don't
        have any friends - only those jerks, Mac and Tom. You'll all
        land up in jail together someday."        
    </p><br>
    
     <p>Your sister gets up to leave. You notice how overweight
        she is. She never gets any exercise. She eats way too much
        junk food and reads trashy movie magazines. She looks at you
        with contempt. "All that those G.I. Joe characters do is grunt.
        No wonder you understand them," she says coldly as she turns
        her back on you to leave the room.        
    </p><br>

        <u><p><b>Relationships</b></p></u><br>
     
    <p> You make a rude face and turn your attention to the movie.
        Rambo has just been trapped in the jungle and is fighting his
        way past the enemy patrol. He is big and harsh looking, with
        his M-16 gun spraying bullets everywhere. With a defiant
        scream, he throws a grenade at the oncoming "gooks," blowing
        them up.               
    </p><br>

         
    <p>Suddenly he is jumped from behind by one of the patrol.
        You watch Rambo fight in hand-to-hand combat with this
        violent looking creature.
        They roll down into the river, where they continue to
        punch, kick, and strike at each other. Rambo grabs the enemy
        by the throat and holds him underwater with a look of crazed
        intensity on his face. Finally Rambo pulls out his commando
        knife and plunges it beneath the surface into the gut of the
        quivering body. The river runs blood red as Rambo, unscathed,
        climbs ashore to meet his next "patriotic" and violent
        adventure.
        
    </p><br>

    <p>There is a strange attraction to these films. You feel the
        excitement; you feel like Rambo. You experience his every
        emotion; your palms sweat and your fists go hard. You want to
        be like him. You have even thought of joining the Commando
        Forces after high school. You want to serve your country
        against the enemy.
        
    </p><br> 


    <p>When you were younger, you used to read war comics and
        play with war toys. G.I. Joe and other action figures were your
        favorites. You took a few lessons in Karate, but you didn't like
        the teacher or the class because they talked about feelings.
        The teacher wasn't a patriot or hero like Rambo, anxious to go
        to battle to defend our country's image. This Karate teacher
        was soft and gentle. He told you that Karate wasn't for
        promoting fighting, but rather for learning about how to
        defend yourself so you don't have to fight. He talked about
        being peaceful and caring, and you thought he was a wimp.
        You bought some Martial Arts weapons instead - nun-chucks
        and a butterfly knife - which you carried until they were
        taken away by Mr. Nathan one day at school.
        </p><br>


    <p>Suddenly your thoughts are interrupted by your father's
        voice coming from the front hall. "Hello, I'm home. Hey,
        anyone here? Come on, let's celebrate!" You can tell he's been
        drinking again. Your stomach suddenly becomes tight and
        starts to ache. Your palms sweat as you clench your fists.
        "Hey buddy, what's the good word?" your father asks,
        entering the family room where you are watching TV.
    </p><br>

    <p>"Nothing," you grunt, not taking your eyes off the TV. You
        can sense your father's anger and frustration behind you. Your
        father and you do not get along very well. Sometimes when he
        drinks, he tries to hit you. When you were little, he did; but
        now you are too quick. One night last year, on your thirteenth
        birthday, you and he finally went at it. He was drunk and
        heard that you had been caught stealing cigarettes from a local
        store.
    </p><br>

    <p>''You bum!" he shouted then. "Why can't you be more like
        your brother Jason? He'd never do anything like that." He
        swung at you, but you ducked and let him have it. Jason, your
        mother, and sister had to break it up.
        You remember that time now and you think angrily, "If he
        only knew who taught me how to steal, he'd die." Jason is the
        biggest thief. He takes his parents' money, liquor, and
        cigarettes right from under their noses, and they don't ever
        seem to notice.
    </p><br>

    <p>You sink down in your chair as your father comes over to
        you. You are ready for whatever happens. You don't care any
        more. Sometimes he gets violent, sometimes he spoils you by
        giving you a bunch of money when he's drunk. You can never
        tell which way he will go. "Hey, buddy, watching old Rambo.
        Great, isn't he? Kills all those gooks. Blows them away. They
        deserve it." He looks at you. "How are you? Get into any
        fights lately? Hope you stand up for yourself, if you're getting
        picked on. Here's a little something to get a treat with (as he
        stuffs a twenty dollar bill into your shirt pocket). Sorry I'm
        late again. Lots of work to do. This family is very expensive to
        support!"
    </p><br>

    <p>You sink even lower in your chair, letting his words and
        his smelly breath go over your head. Rambo is moving across
        the jungle to the enemy airstrip. He is trying to get an Attack
        Hawk Helicopter. You've seen this scene before. He captures
        the helicopter and flies over the enemy compound shooting
        rockets into the enemy barracks, bodies flying in all directions,
        fire and smoke everywhere. You fix your eyes on that
        flickering screen, hands sweaty, fists clenched, waiting for the
        big kill.
